# Results Summary

Exploratory analyses examined associations between sleep duration, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness with cognitive performance across executive control (Stroop task), vigilance (Psychomotor Vigilance Task), and working memory (N-Back task).

Sleep duration and sleep quality were not significantly associated with Stroop reaction time. A weak negative trend was observed between sleep duration and vigilance performance, although this relationship did not reach statistical significance. Daytime sleepiness was not significantly related to vigilance.

Working memory accuracy showed no significant associations with sleep duration, sleep quality, or daytime sleepiness.

Overall, these findings suggest that inter-individual differences in sleep-related measures did not strongly predict cognitive performance across multiple cognitive domains in this healthy sample.
